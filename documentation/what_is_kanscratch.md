# What is KanScratch?
KanScratch is a classroom solution of MIT's popular block-based programming language, Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/).

# Isn't Scratch already Classroom Friendly?
In some ways, yes. It is really good at teaching the fundamentals of programming, and the logic that goes into it. However, when a project is created on Scratch, it is either entirely public, or entirely private. This makes assigning projects to students tricky as it can lead to either requiring the student to have their projects publicly available on Scratch (which could lead to cheating and/or FERPA violations), or it requires the teacher to see the student's projects on their personal account (which is inconvenient as you can't share private projects through a link).

# Where does KanScratch come in?
KanScratch allows teachers to host a classroom (similar to classrooms in Google Classroom) in which they can assign projects to students in the class. Students would join the classroom their teacher creates through a "class code" (a random unique hashed passcode), and use the scratch-gui that is embedded in the site to create the project, and submit the project so teachers know that the assignment is ready to grade. When ready to grade, teachers will direct to student's projects on KanScratch, and assign a grade in their school's respective grading software (Canvas, Skyward, etc).
